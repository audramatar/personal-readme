# Things to know about me
I'm a software engineer on Planet Express. I've been with the company since June 1st 2015 and started my career in support. I did some mentorships with some people on the engineering side and ended up coming over about three years in. 

I live in Austin, have two cats, and I prefer doing front end work over everything else ( though that's not to say I don't enjoy other work as well ).

# What I value
- Constructive feedback
- Structured meetings
- Lots of uninterupted focus time
- Quick feedback loops
- Clear communication

# The day-to-day
**Communication**
- Slack is best for me. You can usually get a hold of me whenever. I'm way too connected.
- I work early typically ( my general working hours are 7-3 )

**Work Style**
- I ask a lot of questions. Let me know if that bugs you and I'll hold back haha.
- Convos via slack vs big meetings is totally my preference.
- I'm a fan of quick video calls to clear things up if things get too complicated over slack. Sometimes that just goes faster.
- Looove lots of focus time. It's great to get into that groove and get a ton done.
