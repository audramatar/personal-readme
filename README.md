# Things to know about me
I'm a total nerd. Basically a hundred precent of my hobbies are computer-based and I live for my hobbies. I play games ( rpgs, strategy games ), dabble in digital art, write fiction nonsense, and occasionally attempt to build games of my own ( though rarely with much success ). I'm also really in to Dungeons and Dragons, though I typically play Pathfinder which is a pretty similar offshoot. That used to be my in-person hobby, but covid has changed that.

I have two sweet kitties -- Sona and Frankie -- and they're spoiled cuddlers. Basically all my furniture is destroyed thanks to their little devil claws, but I love them anyway.

I'm also really in to anime so if you wanna geek out about that stuff with me, I'm totally game. I've been trying to learn Japanese in a vain attempt to one day be able to watch them without subtitles. It's a journey I've not had a lot of success with, haha.

# What I value
**Constructive feedback**: I know I'm junior compared to the rest of the people on the team so I'm always looking to improve. For me, getting feedback is so important. I want to get better and do things _right_, even if sometimes I only really know how to 'get it working', if that makes sense. Feedback with examples or code snippets tend to work much better for me too rather than just explinaions. I tend to get lost in the words but I can usually pick up on code patterns.

**Willingness to answer questions**: Back to the junior thing, I know I have a lot of questions. I do try to find answers on my own first, of course, but it's so incredible to me when someone doesn't mind me asking questions about something I'm stuck on. Obviously this isn't something everyone enjoys. I know it can be an interrupt, and sometimes you don't just have the space to do it in your day. I just want to highlight how much I appreciate someone taking the time to answer my questions. I am more grateful than you probably know.

**Short meetings -- lots of focus time**
